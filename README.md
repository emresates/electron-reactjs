# Electron with ReactJS

### Step 1: Open your terminal and paste,

```
git clone https://github.com/emresates/electron-reactjs
```

### Step 2: Install node modules.

```
npm install
```

### Step 3: Before you start your app, you should run this code on the terminal screen.

```
npm run watch
```

##### This will update every change you make to your file in build/app.js. Therefore, it is necessary to be constantly working in a separate terminal.

### Step 4: You can start your app now.

```
npm start
```
